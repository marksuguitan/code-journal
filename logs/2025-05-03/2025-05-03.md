# Lessons

## 1. Architect Lambda Functions and SDKs Properly

- Build a proxy Lambda function that routes requests to LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.
- Create an `AI` class SDK to standardize communication between your apps and the backend.
- Keep API keys and logic in the backend to improve security and maintainability.

---

## 2. Eliminate Redundant Lambda Wrappers

- Avoid wrapping the `AI` class in an extra Lambda unless necessary.
- Use the class directly in frontend or backend apps for faster performance and simpler architecture.

---

## 3. Route LLM Requests Through the Backend

- Never call LLM APIs directly from the frontend.
- Create a backend service to manage API keys, rate limits, retries, and logging.
- Use the backend to abstract provider selection and ensure a secure, consistent interface.

---

## 4. Manage Dependencies with Best Practices

- Track dependencies using `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.
- Pin package versions to avoid conflicts.
- Enable automated updates with tools like `dependabot`.
- Always review changelogs before upgrading libraries.

---

## 5. Use Virtual Environments for Local Dev

- Run `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` to create a clean dev environment.
- Keep development isolated from the system Python environment.

---

## 6. Organize Dependencies for SAM Projects

- Decide between a root-level `requirements.txt` or one per function folder.
  - Use a single file for shared dependencies.
  - Use per-function files to reduce deployment package size.
- Let `sam build` handle dependency installation for each function.

---

## 7. Remember Each Lambda is Isolated

- Treat each function as its own environment with its own files and environment variables.
- Donât rely on shared memory or imports between functions at runtime.

---

## 8. Document Each Function with a README

- Place a `README.md` in each function folder.
- Include:
  - Purpose
  - Trigger (API, S3, etc.)
  - Input/output examples
  - Required environment variables
  - Dependencies
  - Local testing instructions

---

## 9. Control Packaging and Costs

- Donât expect SAM to analyze your Python imports â explicitly include necessary files.
- Use `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` to exclude dev and build artifacts.
- Keep deployment packages small and clean.

---

## 10. Follow General Best Practices

- Write clean, modular, testable code.
- Use automation for changelogs and updates.
- Secure sensitive config with environment variables or Secrets Manager.
- Keep your architecture lean and scalable.


---

## 11. Pretty-Print JSON Output with `json.dumps()`

- Use `json.dumps(obj, indent=2)` to format JSON with readable indentation.
- Pass the `indent` argument to add line breaks and spacing for clarity.
- Prefer pretty-printed JSON when debugging or logging structured data.

---

## 12. Pyenv 

### What is pyenv?

`pyenv` is a Python version management tool that allows you to easily install and switch between multiple versions of Python on your system.

#### Key Features
- Install multiple versions of Python side-by-side (e.g., 3.9.16, 3.10.13, 3.13.0)
- Switch global Python version with `pyenv global`
- Set a local version per project using `pyenv local` and a `.python-version` file
- Keeps your system Python untouched
- Works well with virtual environment tools like `pyenv-virtualenv`

---

### Why Use pyenv?

- Avoids conflicts with the system-installed Python
- Supports projects requiring different Python versions
- Simplifies version switching and environment management

### Common Commands

```bash
# Install a specific Python version
pyenv install 3.10.13

# Set the global (default) Python version
pyenv global 3.10.13

# Set the local version for a project (creates .python-version file)
pyenv local 3.10.13

# List installed Python versions
pyenv versions

# Uninstall a Python version
pyenv uninstall 3.10.13
```

---

### Notes

- You must restart your shell or run `pyenv rehash` after installing new versions.
- You may need to install build dependencies (e.g., using `pyenv-doctor` or `brew install`) for some systems.

## 13. Parameters vs. Environment Variables — Main Learning Points

- **Drive template logic with Parameters.**  
  Declare stack‑wide inputs in the `Parameters:` section and set them at deploy time (`sam deploy --parameter-overrides …`).  
  Use them to choose resource names, sizes, ARNs, or even whether a resource exists.

- **Drive runtime behaviour with Environment Variables.**  
  Define key–value pairs under `Function → Environment → Variables`.  
  Access them in code via `os.getenv("KEY")` to toggle features, point to databases, hold API keys, etc.

- **Remember scope and visibility.**  
  Parameters are consumed only by CloudFormation/SAM during stack creation or update; your code never sees them unless you pass them on.  
  Environment variables are injected into the Lambda process every invocation and are immediately available to your application code.

- **Use Parameters as compile‑time inputs, Env Vars as run‑time inputs.**  
  Example pattern:  
  ```yaml
  Parameters:
    StageName:
      Type: String
      Default: dev

  Environment:
    Variables:
      STAGE: !Ref StageName          # pass parameter down
  ```
  The stack stays reusable, while the function still “knows” it is running in **dev**, **qa**, or **prod**.

- **Minimise blast radius.**  
  Changing a Parameter usually triggers a full stack update (resources may be replaced).  
  Updating an environment variable only updates the function’s configuration; no other resources are touched.

- **Validate and describe Parameters.**  
  Add `Type`, `AllowedValues`, `Default`, and `Description` to catch bad deploy‑time input early.  
  Environment variables have no built‑in validation—handle errors in code.

- **Encrypt sensitive values in Env Vars.**  
  Lambda encrypts environment variables at rest (optionally with your own KMS key).  
  Parameters are plain metadata unless you pipe them through Secrets Manager or SSM.

- **Leverage Conditions with Parameters.**  
  Define conditions like  
  ```yaml
  Conditions:
    IsProd: !Equals [ !Ref StageName, "prod" ]
  ```  
  Then attach them to resources or pick environment‑variable values via `!If`.

- **Derive convenience booleans in code.**  
  ```python
  STAGE  = os.getenv("STAGE", "dev").lower()
  IS_PROD = STAGE == "prod"          # handy shorthand
  ```

- **Stay consistent in naming.**  
  `STAGE`, `APP_ENV`, `DEPLOY_ENV`—pick one that matches team vocabulary.  
  Consistency across stacks, dashboards, and code beats clever names.

# What's New

- `hypersynaptic` python package was created using AWS CodeArtifact. Didn't want to use PyPi because it is public.
  - see: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codeartifact/d/546423515903/hypersynaptic/r/python-sdk/p/pypi/hypersynaptic/versions?region=us-east-1&package-versions-meta=eyJmIjp7fSwicyI6e30sIm4iOjIwLCJpIjowfQ
