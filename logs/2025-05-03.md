# Today I Learned

- json.dumps() has a feature that can make json output "pretty" or a "Pretty-print the dictionary" feature which looks like this:

  ```python
  json.dumps(response, indent=2)
  ```

  The pretty-print feature in Python's JSON library is activated by passing the indent argument to json.dumps(). When you specify a number (e.g. indent=2), the output JSON string will include newlines and spaces that correspond to the provided indentation level. This makes the structure of the JSON data much clearer and easier to read for humans.

# What's New

- `hypersynaptic` python package was created using AWS CodeArtifact. Didn't want to use PyPi because it is public.
  - see: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codeartifact/d/546423515903/hypersynaptic/r/python-sdk/p/pypi/hypersynaptic/versions?region=us-east-1&package-versions-meta=eyJmIjp7fSwicyI6e30sIm4iOjIwLCJpIjowfQ
