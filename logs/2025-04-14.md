## Docker Template GitHub Repo

- Created a `docker-template` repository containing a `README.md` that outlines best practices for container lifecycle management.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Add a template `Dockerfile` with comments explaining each section.
  - Include a section on `Dockerfile` best practices.

---

## Database Template GitHub Repo

- Created a `database-templates` repository with subdirectories organized by database type:
  - PostgreSQL
  - DynamoDB
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Add a `Makefile` to the DynamoDB subdirectory.

## Ongoing Projects

### CodeHealth Migration

- need to migrate route 53 hosted zones from the old CodeHealth AWS account to Medzcool AWS account

### Case Report Schema Refactor (Medzcool Backend)

- Refactor Case Report database schema. Currently the `cases` schema is so complicated. The goal with the updated schema is to make it easier to understand and implement.
- New Schema should be an abstraction from a "base" model. Where the base model simply handles `Question`, `Answer`, `Explanation`. This way the schema can be flexible in not just handling multiple choice questions but can be a spec for different user cases, not just medical multiple choice questions.

### Use JWT Authentication (Medzcool Frontend)

- Refactor all front end react apps to use JWT Authentication

### AWS Fargate Python-ai endpoint

Creating a new python-based API on AWS fargate which handles anything related to AI, such as LLMs, Text-to-speech or speech-to-text, creating my own model, etc. Currently I am working on:

- LLM chat/response endpoint - setting up an endpoint to OpenAI. This endpoint should be reusable for various LLM response tasks and the end user would just supply their own instructions, input history, or any customizations to their model.

- Speech-To-Text - this endpoint will allow me to collect information from things like podcasts or youtube videos and convert them to text for an LLM model to analyze and eventually synthesize something like a `AI Newsfeed` that I can listen to in the morning.

## Future Projects

### AI Newsfeed

This AI collect information from things like podcasts or youtube videos, my personal notes, journals, emails, etc, and converts them to text for an LLM model to analyze and eventually synthesize something like a `AI Newsfeed` that I can listen to in the morning.

### Medzcool Microservices

Take various components of the Medzcool backend on django and elastic beanstalk and break them up into microservices using things like AWS lambda, and AWS Fargate. I believe this separation of concerns will make it easier in the future to manage my codebase. Currently my struggle with the Django monorepo is that any errors or problems in the Django backend can potentially shutdown the entire backend. Separating the backend into microservices can potentially mitigate this.

### AI Helpers/Assistants/Coaches

I want to eventually make AI work for me such as AI engineers for Medzcool that would help code - they would use a different branch and I would just tell that AI engineer what to code in natural language. This AI engineer would submit a pull request for me to review to confirm their work before pulling into main branch.

For AI coaches, I envision an AI that would analyze my `Journal` and `TODOs` and `Email`, really just analyzing any context about my life that I provide to it and this AI would help me organize all this information and triage things like telling me what it would recommend should be done for the day or the week, etc.
